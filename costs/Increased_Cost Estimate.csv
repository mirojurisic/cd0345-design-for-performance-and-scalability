"* AWS Pricing Calculator provides only an estimate of your AWS fees and doesn't include any taxes that might apply. Your actual fees depend on a variety of factors, including your actual usage of AWS services."
In production, usually stronger/faster HW is to be used for EC2 and for RDSs in order to get better response time, better user experience escpecially in a peak time of the day.
